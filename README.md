Data-Driven Insights for Safer Roads
Built with Microsoft Excel | Data Cleaning • Visualization • Dashboarding

# 🌟 Project Summary

This project demonstrates my ability to turn raw data into actionable insights using Excel as a powerful analytics tool.
I built an interactive dashboard to analyze accident patterns across Montgomery County, USA. The dashboard provides insights into time-based trends, driver demographics, accident severity, vehicle types, and high-risk hotspots.

This project highlights my data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization skills, which are crucial for real-world analytics and business intelligence roles.
